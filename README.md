# ewalds-solver
Brute-force solver that finds scattered wave-vectors for a crystal lattice and an incident wave

Requirements: Python 3, numpy

Notes: if the lattice vectors have a factor of a, you can ignore it, as long as the incident wave-vector has a factor of 1/a (and the scattered wave-vectors then gain the same factor).
